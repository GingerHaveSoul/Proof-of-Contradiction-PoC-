# Proof-of-Contradiction (PoC)
**A Write-Condition for Durable Claims**

## Definition

Proof-of-Contradiction (PoC) is a documentation protocol that requires any durable claim to be recorded alongside at least one credible, structured opposing view.

PoC does not determine which view is correct.
It ensures that disagreement is preserved.

## Purpose

PoC exists to:

- reduce false consensus

- preserve intellectual dissent

- slow narrative capture

- maintain epistemic humility over time

It is a memory constraint, not a truth test.

## Core Rule

A claim qualifies for durable record only if it includes:

1. The claim itself

2. A credible opposing or conflicting view

3. The internal logic of that opposing view

4. Known failure modes of the primary claim or its dissent

If credible contradiction cannot be documented, the claim may still be recorded, but flagged as:

> “Low-Contradiction Record”

This flag indicates absence of documented dissent, not correctness.

## What PoC Does Not Do

PoC:

- does not judge truth

- does not resolve disputes

- does not provide decisions

- does not rank moral positions

- does not eliminate authority

It only preserves structured disagreement.

## Scope

PoC can be applied to:

- historical records

- ethical claims

- policy frameworks

- institutional memory

- research documentation

- long-term archives

It is most useful where:

- stakes are high

- narratives evolve

- power or legitimacy is involved

## Design Principles

PoC favors:

- durability over speed

- transparency over closure

- pluralism over consensus

- documentation over persuasion

## Licensing Intent 

PoC is intended as a public epistemic tool.
Where public domain dedication is not recognized, it is provided under CC0-equivalent terms.
No ownership or exclusivity is implied or required.

End.
